<h2>Managing Geolocation In Your Browser</h2>
<p>Once you've declined giving access to your location to a web page, re-enabling your browser to know where you are physically located requires you to manually give that permission.  Every browser has a different means for you to give that permission.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=#chrome>Google Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href=#edge>Microsoft Edge</a></li>
<li><a href=#firefox>Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href=#safari>Apple Safari</a></li>
<li><a href=#others>others</a></li>
</ul>

From the Lock icon, change the Location permission to Allow or Ask; or if you clicked on the Bullseye icon, you'll see a list of sites that have been blocked from tracking your location -- click "clear these settings for future visits".</p>

<h3 id="edge">Microsoft Edge</h3>

</ul></p>

<h3 id="others">All others</h3>
<p>There are many different versions of the above browsers and there is no real standard means to allow location access for a website after you've blocked it.  Usually there will be some sort of Lock or Info icon available in the address/location bar, or as a menu item labeled Page Info or similar.</p>
