<h2>Managing Geolocation In Your Browser</h2>
<p>Once you've declined giving access to your location to a web page, re-enabling your browser to know where you are physically located requires you to manually give that permission.  Every browser has a different means for you to give that permission.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=#chrome>Google Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href=#edge>Microsoft Edge</a></li>
<li><a href=#firefox>Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href=#safari>Apple Safari</a></li>
<li><a href=#others>others</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chrome">Google Chrome</h3>
<p>Chrome is the most widely installed browser, and is available on Windows, Mac, Android, and iPhone/iPad.  In the address bar, click on the Lock or Bullseye icons.  From the Lock icon, change the Location permission to Allow or Ask; or if you clicked on the Bullseye icon, you'll see a list of sites that have been blocked from tracking your location -- click "clear these settings for future visits".</p>

<h3 id="edge">Microsoft Edge</h3>
<p>Edge is the default browser installed on Windows 10.  In the corner of the address bar, select the Lock  , Info , or Dangerous  icon and select Site permissions.  Next to Location, choose Ask (default), Allow, or Block from the list.
</p>

<h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>
<p>Firefox is a popular open-source browser.   In the location bar, select the Lock or Location icon, look in the Permissions section, and allow Location access.</p>

<h3 id="safari">Apple Safari</h3>
<p>Safari is the default browser installed on Mac, iPhone, and iPad.  From the Safari menu (next to the Apple menu), choose Settings for This Website.  
A pop-over should appear, with a Location setting at the bottom.</p>

<h3 id="others">All others</h3>
<p>There are many different versions of the above browsers and there is no real standard means to allow location access for a website after you've blocked it.  Usually there will be some sort of Lock or Info icon available in the address/location bar, or as a menu item labeled Page Info or similar.</p>
